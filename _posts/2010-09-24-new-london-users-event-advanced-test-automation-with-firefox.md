Although it's been scheduled for a while, the next London Selenium Users meetup
event has now been officially announced. As before, Google will be generously
hosting the event, which this time is Firefox flavoured! There will be four
presentations, mostly by folks from Mozilla, but also an update from Simon
Stewart on the progress of Selenium 2. Head over to
[the event page](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/calendar/14712022/) on
meetup.com for all the latest details.
