The first London Selenium meetup took place on the 11th November. If you weren't
able to make it then due to the success I will be scheduling another one early
in the new year. <!--more-->

![First London Selenium Meetup Event]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/meetup.jpg)

From the feedback I've received it seems people would like some sort of
presentation or demo at the next event. If you would like to volunteer to talk
at the next event please get in touch via the
[Meetup.com group page](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon). Please also get
in touch if you have suggestions for a venue, or suggestions for topics that
you'd like to hear about.

Some suggested topics are below. Soon I will combine these with any other
suggestions into a poll to see what is most popular. You can make further
suggestions by responding to
[this message](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/messages/boards/thread/8057379).

 1. Stop pausing - testing AJAX with Selenium by waiting instead of pausing
 1. **Minimising impact of UI changes using the UI-Elements map**
 1. Introduction to locating elements by XPath and CSS
 1. **Integrating Selenium tests into a continuous build**

You can see a few photos of the first meetup

Finally, I'd like to once again thank the sponsors Paul Humphreys from
[Clear Cube Consulting](http://www.clearcubeconsulting.com/) & Phil Smith from
[Cloud Testing](http://www.cloudtesting.com/) for their support by providing
venue and refreshments costs for the first event. I hope they benefited from
the event as much as everyone else!
