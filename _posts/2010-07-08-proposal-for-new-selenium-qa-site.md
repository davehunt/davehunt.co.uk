If you're not already aware of the
[dedicated Selenium Q&A site](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4693/selenium) that I have proposed, then it's definitely worth checking it out. If you're
interested in supporting the proposal, and helping it to reach beta then please
[commit](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4693/selenium?referrer=l3hVtTWVlCTWgagw76fBpg2).
By committing you are stating that you are prepared to both ask and answer
questions on the proposed site.<!--more-->

# So why does Selenium need a new site for Q&A?

Well, first let me give you some history of the official Selenium forums. When
I first started to get involved in the Selenium community there was the
[Clearspace forums](http://seleniumhq.org/clearspace.html), which provided a
good structure, a pretty good interface, and a basic reward system. The main
problems I had with Clearspace was searching the content, identifying unanswered
questions, and the alarming regularity of certain basic (but very suitable)
questions. Another issue turned out to be spam, which I believe was the main
reason the content was migrated - after much discussion - to
[Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users/).

I was 100% for this move, however with hindsight I believe it wasn't the best
decision. Google Groups is great for discussions but not a suitable place for
Q&A. It might be powerful in terms of search, but the format of text and
structure of conversations makes it very difficult to identify questions, and
there's little or no incentive in answering them. Whenever I've taken time to
read the posts in the group I've almost always lost interest after reading just
one or two - there's just so much text!

At this time the StackOverflow site was already becoming a popular place to ask
Selenium questions - there are now over
[600 questions tagged 'selenium'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium).
Once I'd asked and answered a handful of questions myself I was hooked.
StackOverflow's mission is to solve the common problems found in other forum
solutions, and they do it very well. Their 'ask a question' system makes it very
obvious if you're asking a question that has already been answered, therefore
filtering out repetition questions but at the same time providing those users
with quality answers. Their rewards system works well to encourage good quality
questions and answers. The only problem is that StackOverflow is for asking
programming questions, and although Selenium does have programming aspects to
it, it's not the perfect fit.

Along comes [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/), which provides the same
underlying solution from StackOverflow to fit an audience other than
programmers. Unfortunately StackExchange was a commercial solution, and as
Selenium is free and open source there wasn't the cash to get something running.
It's also difficult to determine if the cost would be worthwhile, as without
community interested the site would get nowhere.

When StackExchange [announced that they would be redesigning their model](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/changes-to-stack-exchange/)
so that community powered Q&A sites would be provided free of charge if they can
prove they have enough committed users, I decided to put forward the Selenium
proposal. After 29 days I'm impressed that the proposal has over **100**
followers, and now has over **80** committed users!

If you've already committed then thank you - I'm really looking forward to
participating with you on the new site!
