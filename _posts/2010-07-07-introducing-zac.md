As he's preparing his first post for SeleniumExamples, it's probably a good time
to introduce Zac! I have worked with Zac in the past and he recently mentioned
having some suitable content for this blog. I thought it'd be easiest to just
give him an account.

I suspect most of Zac's contributions will be .Net or C# examples, which is
something I have little experience of myself. If you're also interested in
submitting content to the blog, get in touch with details of what you'd like to
contribute and a bit about yourself.
