I've decided that Wordpress is really overkill for what I need, so I'm going to
experiment with using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to maintain a simple blog using
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The idea of [Blogging Like a
Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)
certainly appeals to me, and if this experiment is successful I will likely
migrate previous blogs into this one over time.
