Last night was the
[May Selenium Users meeting in San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/13311788/),
where [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) and
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) presented their use of Selenium.
[Adam Goucher](http://adam.goucher.ca/) (Selenium IDE maintainer) was there, and
has [provided his notes on his blog](http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1466). It sounds
like it was a great event, hopefully there'll be some videos online soon!
