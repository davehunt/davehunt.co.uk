Before holding the second London Selenium Users meetup we asked several
questions of the Selenium users in London<!--more-->:

 * What is your level of experience with Selenium?
 * What do you want to know about Selenium 2?
 * What language would you like to see Selenium 2 demos in?

Below are the slides that I didn't get time to show at the event.
