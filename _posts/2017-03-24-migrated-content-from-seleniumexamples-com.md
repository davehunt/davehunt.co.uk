I ran a blog at seleniumexamples.com from 2009-2011, where I posted examples
for using Selenium. This content has been unavailable for some time, so I
decided to migrate it here. Many of the examples are unlikely to work, and I
didn't bother to migrate comments, but it might at least prove interesting to
some. Personal highlights include [playing Pacman][pacman],
[the first London meetup][london], and [cheesecake][]. You can find the entire
archive [here][archive].

[pacman]: {% post_url 2010-05-25-play-pacman-with-selenium-2 %}
[london]: {% post_url 2009-11-25-a-successful-first-london-selenium-meetup %}
[cheesecake]: {% post_url 2010-11-07-cheesecake %}
[archive]: /tag/seleniumexamples.com.html
