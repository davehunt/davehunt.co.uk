This year marked my return to [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/), which I last
attended in 2013. On my previous visit I did a joint talk with
[Henrik Skupin](https://www.hskupin.info/) on [Automating Firefox OS](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/automating_firefox_os/)
and we thought it would be fun to return with another talk on automating
the desktop Firefox application using Selenium.<!--more-->

Unfortunately, Henrik wasn't able to attend due to sickness in his family, so I
gave the talk on my own. The talk was named after
[FoxPuppet](http://foxpuppet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), our Python package
that helps us to automate Firefox. I also brought along a real life fox puppet,
which I decided to name Henrik as he wasn't able to be there in person. You can
[watch the talk](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/mozilla_firefox_puppet_show/)
(sorry for the poor audio quality), and
[see the slides](https://whimboo.github.io/slides/170204_fosdem/) online.
