Due to the impressive response to the first London Selenium Meetup event, I am
pleased to announce that I have increased the RSVP limit from 30 to 40. Head
over to the [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon) or
[Event](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/calendar/11256642/) page to join
and RSVP. If the 40 places are already full then add yourself to the waiting
list and you'll be notified if anybody drops out.
